JSMN - Minimalistic JSON parser library
=======================================

jsmn (pronounced right as `jasmine`) is a simple and clean library for parsing
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data format.

You can find more information on JSON at http://www.json.org/

Philosophy
==========

jsmn will never be large and complex. This means it will never have extra
features or any bloated dependencies, besides libc.
It will always be suitable for embedded systems and other resource-limited
systems. It will always have clear API.

Features
========

o Just 200 lines of code
o Full C89 compatibility
o No memory allocation inside the library code
o A single pass is required to parse JSON data
o MIT license (you can include this code into your proprietary software)
